## Built-in Themes

The current version of Celestial includes two built-in themes, namely dark and light (case-sensitive in key values).

If you want to switch, please refer to the [Switching Themes](#switching-themes) section.

## Custom Themes

You can add theme JSON files in the ~/.cubewhy/lunarcn/themes directory, and the format should be consistent with IntelliJ IDEA themes.

## Switching Themes

1. Open ~/.cubewhy/lunarcn/celestial.json
2. Find the `theme` key and change its value to the desired theme name (example: dark, light, myTheme.json)
